# #######  ABOUT ASSIGNMENT ######### #

● Instead of <Python> in this assignment i have used <Node.js> which is the run time environment for javascript but i know python language

● Instead of <Flask> in this assignment i have used <Express.js> as a backend framework which is the most popular backend framework of Node.js but sorry to say I did not use any project upon <Flask> but i can did this because <LANGUAGE & FRAMEWORK as well as DATABASES> are like a piece of cake for every developer.

● Instead of SQL databse in this assignment i have used MongoDB as a Database . but i know some commands of SQL

● In this assignment i have used most popular package <joi> for proper validation 

● In this assignment i have used <bcrypt> package for encrypt the password and stored it in database

● In this assignment i have used proper authentication as well as authorization also

● In this assignment i have used <isDeleted key> because in industry there are 2 types of delete method we can use 
1] soft delete 
2] hard delete 
Here i have use soft delete means at the time of delete data we have to only change the key to <isDeleted : true>
